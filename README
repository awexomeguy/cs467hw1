Our mobile and sensor network is represented by a JTree.

The tree's internal nodes are represented by folder symbols, and the leaf nodes are represented by file symbols. 

The content of each node of the tree is listed right next to it. 

Each leaf represent one cell (or base station) in a sensor network.  

Each leaf is identified by a name that reflects its content. 
So if a leaf has three phone numbers, say 2, 3, and 4, then this leaf is represented by the name: [2,3,4]. 
And [2,3,4] would be used to represent the actuall location of the phones 2, 3, and 4.  
So whenever you see [...] just be aware that it is refering to a cell. 

ValueTree is the implementation of the hierarchical location management tree using real locations.
So if an internal node has this heading {7=[7,8],12=[12]} that means this internal node has a map 
that stores the locations of phones 7 and 12.  
7's location is cell [7,8] and 12's location is [12]. 
"7's location is [7,8]" may look like there is no real location information, but internally, 
[7,8] is a unique data object that is as distinct as if we have called that leaf "cell z."

PointerTree is the implementation of the hierarchical location management tree using pointers.
Pointers are represented by integers 0, 1, 2, 3 ... to refer to the first child, second child, and third child of the node.
So if an internal node of a tree has a heading like {1=0, 5=1, 6=2} means phone number 1 is in the first child node, 
5 is in the second child and 6 is in the third child.

For ReplicationTree, the user is encouraged to activate multiple calls to see the effects of replication, 
as replication only happens when the local call to move ratio reaches a certain point.  
User is also encouraged to move a phone to see how replication sites are also updated.  
We can also change S_max, S_min, N_max and L to manipulate the replication 
(this part is done in code but user is not given a chance to change these in graphical interface).

For ForwardingPointerTree, the user is encouraged to activate multiple calls to see the effects of forwarding pointers.
A forwarding pointer is created when the number of calls from a certain cell to a number is high, and the pointer gets
torn down when calls between that cell and number start to decline.
 
For simulation comparison, each call or move would generate its search cost and update cost.  

We also has a the capability for making a large number of calls or moves with randomly generated phone numbers. 
User needs to enter the number of runs they desire in the first field (source) on the interface.
Culmulative search cost and update cost will be calculated.

To compile:
extract all files from the .zip file into one directory
on the command line, use the command
 javac *.java
to produce all the executable .class files

To run:
open any of the .html files in a browser
